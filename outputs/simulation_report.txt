Simulation Report
==================

Link Failure: R1-R2
Affected nodes: ['R1', 'R2']

Validations:
MTU mismatch on link R1-R2 VLAN 10: 1500 vs 1400

Recommendations:
Link R1-SW1 (50 Mbps) may saturate under peak 60 Mbps. Recommend activating/engineering secondary paths or traffic shaping for low-priority flows.
Link R2-SW2 (50 Mbps) may saturate under peak 80 Mbps. Recommend activating/engineering secondary paths or traffic shaping for low-priority flows.
Consider using BGP for inter-domain paths; keep OSPF intra-domain.
Aggregate SW1 into its upstream router to reduce node count, if policy permits.
Aggregate SW2 into its upstream router to reduce node count, if policy permits.
