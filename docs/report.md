# Project Report — Network Topology Simulator

## 1. Introduction

Modern enterprise networks are increasingly complex, requiring automated tools for topology 
generation, validation, optimization, and fault simulation. This project implements a 
**Network Topology Simulator** to meet the requirements outlined in the Cisco VIP 2025 
Networking problem statement.

## 2. Objectives

- Automate topology creation from device configuration files.   
- Verify link capacities against expected traffic loads.   
- Detect configuration errors: duplicate IPs, VLAN/gateway issues, MTU mismatches, loops.   
- Recommend optimizations such as node aggregation and protocol choice.   
- Simulate Day‑1 (boot, ARP, neighbor discovery) and Day‑2 (link failures, re‑configuration) events.   

## 3. System Architecture

The solution is structured into distinct modules:

- **Configuration Parser**: Extracts device roles, interfaces, endpoints, and routing flags.  
- **Topology Builder**: Establishes connectivity based on neighbor references, VLAN IDs, MTU, and bandwidth.  
- **Validator**: Performs integrity checks across IP addressing, VLANs, gateways, and physical loops.  
- **Optimizer**: Provides load balancing recommendations, protocol suggestions, and node aggregation opportunities.  
- **Simulator**: Multithreaded device model exchanging metadata packets via IPC; supports fault injection.  
- **Main Orchestrator**: Integrates the workflow, writes outputs, and generates a topology diagram.  

A lightweight in‑memory IPC bus models FIFO/TCP messaging. This design can be extended to real sockets for distributed simulation. 

## 4. Implementation Highlights

- **Programming Language**: Python (modular structure).  
- **Concurrency**: Each device represented by a thread.  
- **IPC**: Implemented via in‑memory message queues (FIFO‑style).  
- **Visualization**: Topology rendered using Matplotlib.  
- **Testing**: Unit tests covering configuration parsing, validation logic, and simulation routines.  

## 5. Outputs

Upon execution, the following deliverables are generated:

- **Topology Diagram (topology.png)** – Hierarchical view of routers and switches.  
- **Simulation Logs (logs.txt)** – Device‑level messages for ARP, OSPF, and neighbor discovery.  
- **Simulation Report (simulation_report.txt)** – Consolidated findings: validation errors, optimization advice, fault impact analysis.  

## 6. Limitations & Future Enhancements

- Parsing currently supports a simplified configuration grammar. Vendor‑specific grammars can be added.  
- IPC is limited to in‑memory queues; extending to sockets would allow distributed, multi‑host simulation.  
- Protocol simulations (ARP, OSPF) are abstracted to log entries. Future work could implement detailed packet exchanges.  
- Load balancing recommendations are heuristic; integration with real traffic engineering policies would improve fidelity.  

## 7. Conclusion

The Network Topology Simulator provides an integrated framework for topology generation, 
configuration validation, network optimization, and simulation. By combining automated parsing, 
multithreaded device modeling, and IPC‑based communication, it demonstrates a practical 
solution aligned with the VIP 2025 networking problem statement.
