### Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each responsibility (parsing, building, validating, simulating) is encapsulated in a separate module.  
- **Concurrency**: Routers and switches are represented as independent threads.  
- **IPC Mechanism**: An inâ€‘memory queue models FIFO/TCP communication between devices. 
- **Scalability**: Supports extension to more devices, advanced simulation scenarios, and real configuration grammars.  
- **Outputs**: All results (logs, reports, diagrams) are stored under `outputs/` for traceability and evaluation.
